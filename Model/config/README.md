Config file templates for the SiteSearchData dumping and loading system

These files should be copied to $GUS_HOME/config, renamed to lose the .tmpl suffix, and edited to add db connect info.

The files are:
* `gus.confg.tmpl`
  * comments in the file indicate the required changes
* `SiteSearchData/model.prop.tmpl`
  * comments in the file indicate the required changes
* `SiteSearchData/model-config.xml.tmpl`  
  * provide connect information for the appDB, userDB and accountDB
